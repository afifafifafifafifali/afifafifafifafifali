# About Me
I'm a random guy in the backrooms. Known to everyone by my both physical and virtual presence. Call me by my pseudonym "Afif". I focus on low-level programming, OS development, and hardware-level projects. Me is interested in AI/ML. 

# Projects
1. DoorsOS: A random x86_64 monolithic kernel based on Limine bootloader. Progress is 60% complete. With remaining: Mouse, ELF parser, Windows and Doom. Working on this thing for 3-4 years with multiple rebrandings.
2. SA-NN: A useful protocol to run Linear PyTorch neural networks on an Arduino UNO.
3. MLWarriors : Unmantained Machine Learning Competitions platform. Mostly in PHP. https://mlwarriors.alwaysdata.net/
